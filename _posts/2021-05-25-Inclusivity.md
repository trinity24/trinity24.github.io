* I volunteered and co-designed (along with Arghya Sadhukhan) introductory material on group theory for high school girls at [Girls Talk Math](http://gtm.math.umd.edu/) during the Summer of 2021. 
* I co-organized CATS (Captial Area Theory Seminar) at University of Maryland, College Park with Nathaniel Grammel during Fall 2021 and Spring 2022.
