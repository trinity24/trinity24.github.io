* Next year, I'll serve as the secretary for UW's chapter of [AWM](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~awmsc/). We host events to help create a supportive and inclusive environment for women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics (WUMiM).

* I teach incarcerated women math through [FEPPS](http://fepps.org). 

* I started volunteering at UW's [Math Circles](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/) during the Spring of 2018.
