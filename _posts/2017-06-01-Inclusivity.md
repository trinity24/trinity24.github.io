* I was a mentor with the [Washington Directed Reading Program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/) during the following quarters: Spring 2019, Fall 2020, Winter 2021. I lead projects with undergraduates outside of the WDRP during the Fall 2019 and Winter 2020 quarters.

* I was the secretary for UW's chapter of [AWM](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~awmsc/) during the 2018-2019 academic year. We host events to help create a supportive and inclusive environment for women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics (WUMiM).

* I co-taught the course Math in Society to an amazing groups of people during the Summer of 2018 through [FEPPS](http://fepps.org). FEPPS provides college education for incarcerated women, trans-identifying, and gender nonconforming people in Washington. I have tutored and done other work through FEPPS, as well.

* I volunteered at UW's [Math Circles](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/) during the Spring of 2018.
