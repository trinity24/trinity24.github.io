% \firstentry{\textbf{Comparing the efficacy of different data-preprocessing techniques in fair classification, University of Maryland}}
%  \hfill {Prof. Soheil Feizi} 

% {Compared the performance of recent data preprocessing techniques in fair classification (eg. Clustering) like data (reweighing techniques (RW), learning fairness representations (LFR), optimized pre-processing(OP) ) under the fairness metric "statistical parity" using open source toolkit AI Fairness 360 on standard data sets available. }


%     Worked on PAF (Probabilistically Approximately Fair) algorithms for combinatorial problems. Specifically designed and analyzed randomized algorithms to ensure fairness in various combinatorial problems like graph matching, set packing, set covering, and clustering problems with real-world applications. 
% {Built a  pre-emptive, multi-tasking {Operating System} from scratch. Implemented demand-paging, copy-on-fork and auto-growing stack functionalities. Created a compatible standard library and bash-like shell to interact with the kernal (OS).}

% \entry{\textbf{Computational Geometry, Stony Brook University}}
% \hfill{Prof. Joseph Mitchell}{}

% { The alpha-fatness and chord-arc scores are different measures of the "niceness" of polygons. They may prove useful in developing quantitative measures by which electoral districts may be determined illegal. This project includes software for implementing these measures together with preliminary results on random polygons. }


% \entry{}{\textbf{Energy Consumption Prediction, Stony Brook University}}
%  \hfill {Prof. Zhenhua Liu} 
 
% {Predicting an year's electricity consumption using the electricity consumption of previous year, time series data at 15min interval for 365 days. Implemented SARIMA, SVM and LSTM models using PyTorch and compared the results for 10 homes. Also enhanced the predictions using smart meter data for various appliances of the same homes.}
